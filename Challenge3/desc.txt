# In this implementation, the function get_value_from_nested_object takes the nested object (obj) and the key (key) as arguments. 
It splits the key into individual levels using the forward slash (/) delimiter. Then, it traverses the nested object by successively accessing each level of the keys in the object. 
If the key is found, the corresponding value is returned. If the key is not found at any level, None is returned.
