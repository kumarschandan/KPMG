This example code creates a resource group, virtual network, and subnets for each tier (web, app, and db). It then deploys virtual machines in each subnet and configures network interfaces for each VM.

Remember to replace the placeholder values with your desired configurations and customize the resource definitions as per your requirements. Additionally, you will need to have Terraform installed and configured with your Azure credentials to run this code.

Please note that the above code is a starting point and may require additional configuration based on your specific needs, such as specifying the VM size, OS image, storage, etc.
